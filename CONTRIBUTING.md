# Contributing Guidelines
Contributions to HCA working group repos are subject to overall HCA
governance and technical guidance. In addition, contributors are
expected to abide by the following guidelines.

1. File structure: At the root of the project, have a directory with a meaningful title that is understandable and accessible. Inside the directory, there needs to be a working example/notebook (.ipynb) and a README.md. Optional files to make your program run are welcomed but not necessary. 

1. Don't break the build: pull requests are expected to pass all
  automated CI checks.

1. Keep the build simple: Automated CI checks that are fragile or don't
  serve a clear agreed upon purpose will be removed.

1. All Pull Request comments must be addressed, even after merge.

1. All code must be reviewed by at least 1 other team member.

1. All Pull Requests relating to an issue must include "connected to 
  #123", where #123 is the issue number.

1. Individual commit messages should clearly express the commit's purpose.

1. To submit a vignette, follow the file structure in place, create a new branch with the user’s name followed by the vignette’s purpose (ie. <firstName>-<topic>-<vignettes>), and create a Pull Request.
