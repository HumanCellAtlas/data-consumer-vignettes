    "For those short on time, here are the steps in a nutshell:\n",

    "> 1) Write an Elasticsearch query with a `bool` and a `must` query, and then add the conditions you want to specify within them (`match` or `reg_exp`, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2) Execute the `post_search` method using the Elasticsearch query you wrote, and from the search results get a bundle.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3) If your search returned no results, it may be helpful try either **a)** examining a bundle closer to see what the fields look like, or **b)** disassembling your search and executing it one piece at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now for the in-depth answer. First, we'll need a query to search with; it might be a little more complicated than the ones we've used in previous vignettes, but the process overall is simple."
