    "Suppose I want to get all bundles that contain T cells _and_ were sequenced using 10x. How should I go about doing this?\n",

    "For those short on time, here are the steps in a nutshell:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1) Write an Elasticsearch query with a `bool` and a `must` subquery, and then add the conditions you want to specify within them (in this case, `match` or `reg_exp`). See the query below for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2) Execute the `post_search` method using the Elasticsearch query you wrote, and from the search results get a bundle.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3) If your search returned no results, it may be helpful to try **a)** checking that the paths to your fields are correct, and/or **b)** disassembling your search and executing it one piece at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now for the in-depth answer. First, we'll need a query to search with; it might be a little more complicated than the ones used in previous vignettes, but the process overall is simple."
